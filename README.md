# 2-Player-Dice-Game
This project is a 2–player interactive dice game built in C++. Players take turns rolling dice, earning points, and triggering special powerups that can change the direction of the game. The program runs entirely in the terminal and focuses on clean game logic, modular functions, and user-friendly output.
